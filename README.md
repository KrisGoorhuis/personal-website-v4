##  What is this?
A portfolio page with more immediate impact than a collection of Github repositories. Hopefully something that folks outside the technical field will appreciate.

## What was it built with?
React, ecosystem packages for localization and lazy loading, Material UI (Masonry for unevenly stacked list items), and Typescript.

## How much of a benefit was Typescript here, and why did you use it anyway?
Very little, and because I rather like it regardless. Outside of prop types for components, there's an enum for language selection and a definition of what a project object is.
